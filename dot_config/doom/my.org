#+title: My Elisp Snippets

This file contains a collection of elisp functions which are ~org-babel-load-file~'d into my Emacs configuration.

* Dotfile Management
Here are some functions used to aid in managing my dotfiles with [[https://www.chezmoi.io/][Chezmoi]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-chezmoi-apply ()
  "Apply chezmoi configuration."
  (interactive)
  (shell-command "chezmoi apply"))

(defvar my-chezmoi-dir (expand-file-name "~/.local/share/chezmoi/"))

(defun my-find-dotfile ()
  "Open a file somewhere in chezmoi via a fuzzy filename search."
  (interactive)
  (doom-project-find-file my-chezmoi-dir))

(defun my-open-dotfiles ()
  "Open chezmoi in Dired."
  (interactive)
  (dired my-chezmoi-dir))
#+end_src

* Eshell Switching
I like to be able to quickly switch between a buffer and an ~eshell~ buffer.
The following functions aid this workflow.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-switch-to-eshell ()
  "Switch to the existing *eshell* buffer or create one if it doesn't exist."
  (interactive)
  (if (get-buffer "*eshell*")
      (switch-to-buffer "*eshell*")
    (eshell)))
#+end_src
