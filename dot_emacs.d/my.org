#+title: My Elisp Snippets

This file contains a collection of elisp functions which are ~org-babel-load-file~'d into my Emacs configuration.

* Dotfile Management
Here are some functions used to aid in managing my dotfiles with [[https://www.chezmoi.io/][Chezmoi]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/chezmoi-apply ()
  "Apply chezmoi configuration."
  (interactive)
  (shell-command "chezmoi apply"))

(defvar my/chezmoi-dir (expand-file-name "~/.local/share/chezmoi/"))

(defun my/open-dotfiles ()
  "Open chezmoi in Dired."
  (interactive)
  (dired my/chezmoi-dir))
#+end_src

* Eshell
I like to be able to quickly switch between a buffer and an ~eshell~ buffer.
The following functions aid this workflow.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/switch-to-eshell ()
  "Switch to the existing *eshell* buffer or create one if it doesn't exist."
  (interactive)
  (if (get-buffer "*eshell*")
      (switch-to-buffer "*eshell*")
    (eshell)))
#+end_src

** Eshell Commands
*** Bookmarks
Open a bookmark by cd'ing to it or find-file'ing it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun pcomplete/eshell-mode/bm ()
  "Completion for `bm'"
  (pcomplete-here (bookmark-all-names)))

(defun eshell/bm (&rest args)
  "cd or open the given bookmark entry"
  (setq args (flatten-tree args))
  (let ((bookmark (car args)) filename)
    (if (setq filename (bookmark-get-filename bookmark))
        ;; If it points to a directory, change to it.
        (if (file-directory-p filename)
            (eshell/cd filename)
          ;; otherwise, just jump to the bookmark
          (bookmark-jump bookmark))
      (error "%s is not a bookmark" bookmark))))
#+end_src

* Org Snippets
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-imenu-narrow ()
  "Prompt for headings with imenu, and narrow on selected heading"
  (interactive)
  ;; TODO
  )
#+end_src
